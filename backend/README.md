# BACKEND DOCUMENTATION

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the backend stack and workflow for this chatbot project. The backend is built using a combination of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It handles API requests, manages data, performs server-side operations, and includes authentication and authorization checks.

## Stack

### 1. Node.js

- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js is the JavaScript runtime used to execute server-side code.

### 2. Express.js

- **Web Framework**: Express.js is the web framework used to build RESTful APIs and handle HTTP requests and responses efficiently.

### 3. MongoDB

- **Database**: MongoDB is the NoSQL database used to store application data in a flexible, document-oriented format.

### 4. Mongoose

- **ODM (Object Data Modeling)**: Mongoose is an ODM library that provides a schema-based solution to model application data and interact with MongoDB.

## Dependencies

### Core Libraries

- **`express`**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **`mongoose`**: ODM for MongoDB to model and interact with data.
- **`cors`**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **`dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Authentication & Security

- **`bcrypt`**: Library for hashing passwords and other security-related hashing functions.
- **`jsonwebtoken`**: Library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) used for authentication and authorization.

### Utility & Logging

- **`morgan`**: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. Used to log incoming requests and responses.
- **`cookie-parser`**: Middleware for parsing cookies sent with HTTP requests.

### Validation

- **`express-validator`**: Middleware for validating and sanitizing user inputs.

### OpenAI Integration

- **`openai`**: Client library for interacting with OpenAI's API to integrate AI capabilities.

### Development Utilities

- **`concurrently`**: Allows running multiple commands concurrently, useful for running the backend and frontend servers simultaneously during development.

## Workflow
